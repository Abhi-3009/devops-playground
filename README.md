# SPE DevOps Project

This repository is a semester-long DevOps project for the
Software Production Engineering course.

The goal is to build and evolve a production-like system by
incrementally adding DevOps concepts such as CI/CD,
containerization, infrastructure automation, orchestration,
and observability.

## Planned Components
- Backend service (Node.js)
- Version control using Git
- Containerization using Docker
- CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins
- Configuration management using Ansible
- Container orchestration using Kubernetes
- Centralized logging and monitoring using ELK stack

## Repository Structure
Each DevOps concept will be added step by step as it is
covered in the course.

## Status
Initial repository setup. Development in progress.
